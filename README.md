# Parallerlized-inter-satallite-link
Parallel Propagation of a constellation of satellites and determining the shortest path between two satellites. 
First, we construct the constellatoin of satellites around earth with a walker-star pattern. Then two methods were used to parallize the code; using mpi4py
and numba. The time performance comparison is also shown. Finally, you can find the part about finding the shortest path between a source and direct satellite.  

This was made as a 3 credits course project. You can find the detailed comments inside the notebook itself.
